MediaPlayer
=======================
This is my digital playground where I am learning. I'm integrating and validating new technologies and ideas here, playing around with new UI / UX components and developing with the best coding standard I come up with.

At the same time I want to provide an audiobook player which is really easy in use and a joy to work with.
There are still some components outdated.

If you like to [contribute](#contrib) or [translate](#trans), that is very appreciated. But there might be impacting structural changes over time.

# <a name="contrib">Contribution</a>

Some rules for coding:
* Use the code style the project uses
* For each feature, make a seperate branch, so it can be reviewed separately
* Use commits with a good description, so one can see, what you did
